# AI-and-Data-Science-Projects
The projects in this repository are on machine learning, big data, computer vision, data structure and algorithm.
# Machine learning: 
Implemented a K-Means clustering model to determine optimal vertiport
placements in South Korea, leveraging geospatial data to inform decision-making.
• Developed and evaluated an MLP regression model to predict travel distances
based on exercise amount and usage time from Seoul City's public bicycle data
• Built classification models using SVM and KNN for detecting leaks in South Korea's
water supply system. The models were evaluated through confusion matrices,
accuracy, precision, and recall.
# Big Data: 
• Developed a linear regression model to predict used car prices based on year,
mileage, engine power, and transmission type, achieving ~90% accuracy, with
recommendations for future improvement.
# Data Structure and Algorithm: 
• Implemented a genetic algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem
(TSP), comparing performance with a greedy algorithm and optimizing solutions
using real-world data.
• Implemented the A* algorithm to optimize flight routes between Jeju and Gimpo
international airports, ensuring safe and efficient flight operations under varying
weather conditions.
# Computer Vision: 
• Breast cancer detection of Mammogram images using Hybrid model Xception+ViT
