**Title**: *A Comparative Approach to Automated Job Title Prediction Using Transformer-based and Machine Learning Models*  
**Author**: Djika Asmaou Houma  
**Institution**: Handong Global University  
**Year**: 2024  
**Supervisor**: Prof. Xiaopeng Yang

**Objective**:  
This project explores and compares the effectiveness of transformer-based deep learning models and classical machine learning algorithms for **automated job title prediction** based on job descriptions.

### üß† **Models Compared**

- **Transformer Models**:
  - BERT
  - DistilBERT
  - RoBERTa
  - DeBERTa

- **Traditional Machine Learning Models**:
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest

---

### üìä **Main Results**

- **DistilBERT** achieved the best overall performance:
  - **Accuracy**: 95%
  - **Advantages**: Faster training time, smaller model size, and high accuracy.
  
- Classical models like Random Forest and SVM were also evaluated, but transformer-based models outperformed them across key metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

### üåç **Implementation Feasibility in Cameroon**

- The study includes a **contextual analysis for Cameroon**, proposing how AI-based job classification systems can assist with:
  - Improving employment services,
  - Supporting career guidance platforms,
  - Enhancing HR automation systems.

- **Challenges discussed**: Open data availability, infrastructure needs, and strategies for sustainable deployment.

### üîß **Methodology**

- Data collected from online job platforms and preprocessed for training.
- Fine-tuned transformer models with max sequence length of 512.
- Evaluation conducted using validation/test accuracy and confusion matrices.
- Visualizations plotted: training vs validation accuracy for each model.

---

### üìå **Key Contributions**

- Demonstrates the effectiveness of transformer models in real-world job classification tasks.
- Recommends **DistilBERT** as a robust, lightweight solution for deployment in resource-constrained environments.
- Provides a roadmap for implementation in **developing countries**, particularly **Cameroon**.
