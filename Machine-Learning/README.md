     - Number of iterations required.
     - Strategy to stop the iterations.
     - Visualization of clustering results.

2. **Task 2: Open-Ended Problem**
   - **Objective**: Distribute a given number of sample points evenly across the South Korea territory using the K-Means algorithm.
   - **Details**: The task involves distributing points (e.g., 10 sample points) across the territory based on the K-Means algorithm.
   - **Presentation Includes**:
     - Strategy used to achieve the distribution.
     - Resulting output visualization.

3. **Task 3: Real-World Problem (Vertiport Placement)**
   - **Objective**: Use the K-Means algorithm to cluster vertiport candidate locations in South Korea, determining the optimal number of vertiports.
   - **Details**: The task involves visualizing the vertiport candidate locations and clustering them to identify 17 final vertiport locations under a budget constraint. Additionally, it includes determining the optimal number of vertiports if financial limitations were removed.
   - **Presentation Includes**:
     - Visualization of candidate locations.
     - Clustering of locations to find the optimal number of vertiports (17).
     - Discussion on the ideal number of vertiports without financial constraints.



### **Classification Modeling and Evaluation (KNN,SVM)**

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Objective**: Implement a data preprocessing module to create a data pipeline that handles the given dataset for further analysis.
   - **Details**: This involves preparing the dataset by cleaning it, handling missing values, normalizing or scaling features, and any other preprocessing required for efficient model training.

2. **Model Design**
   - **Objective**: Design a classification model to analyze the dataset and predict the class labels (Outdoor leakage, Indoor leakage, Noise, Environmental noise, and Normal).
   - **Details**: In this step, you'll create the model using suitable algorithms and provide an explanation of the model's structure. You may need to customize features from the dataset, as this will influence the model's accuracy and the interpretability of the results.

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Objective**: Evaluate the performance of your model using a confusion matrix.
   - **Details**: You will calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall of the model. Note that while you can use libraries to implement the classification algorithm, you must write your own code to evaluate the model's performance with the confusion matrix.

4. **Model Improvement Discussion**
   - **Objective**: After evaluating the model, discuss the results with your team to identify areas for improvement in both the classification model and the feature customization approach.
   - **Details**: This task involves collaboration with your teammates to improve the model by refining the classification strategy or adjusting the features for better results.



### **Regression Modeling and Evaluation**

1. **MLP-based Regression Model**
   - **Objective**: Develop a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)-based regression model using the dataset. The model will map input features, Exercise Amount and Usage Time, to the output, Travel Distance.
   - **Details**: You need to explain the structure of the MLP regression model in detail. You may also need to decide how to divide the dataset for training and testing purposes.

2. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Objective**: Evaluate the performance of the MLP regression model.
   - **Details**: You are required to calculate the R-squared value, plot actual vs. predicted values, plot residuals vs. predicted values, and compute the model's representation error.

3. **Model Evaluation Discussion**
   - **Objective**: After evaluating the model, discuss the results with your teammates.
   - **Details**: This task involves reviewing the model's performance with your team and identifying areas for improvement based on the evaluation results.
