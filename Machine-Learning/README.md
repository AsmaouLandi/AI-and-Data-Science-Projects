### **Clustering-Using K-Means**

1. **Task 1: Toy Problem**
   - **Objective**: Use the K-Means algorithm to create three clusters from eight given points in a 2D Cartesian plane.
   - **Details**: The centroids are pre-determined at (2,10), (5,8), and (1,2), associated with Cluster 1, Cluster 2, and Cluster 3, respectively. The goal is to perform clustering and determine the number of iterations required to complete the process.
   - **Presentation Includes**:
     - Number of iterations required.
     - Strategy to stop the iterations.
     - Visualization of clustering results.

2. **Task 2: Open-Ended Problem**
   - **Objective**: Distribute a given number of sample points evenly across the South Korea territory using the K-Means algorithm.
   - **Details**: The task involves distributing points (e.g., 10 sample points) across the territory based on the K-Means algorithm.
   - **Presentation Includes**:
     - Strategy used to achieve the distribution.
     - Resulting output visualization.

3. **Task 3: Real-World Problem (Vertiport Placement)**
   - **Objective**: Use the K-Means algorithm to cluster vertiport candidate locations in South Korea, determining the optimal number of vertiports.
   - **Details**: The task involves visualizing the vertiport candidate locations and clustering them to identify 17 final vertiport locations under a budget constraint. Additionally, it includes determining the optimal number of vertiports if financial limitations were removed.
   - **Presentation Includes**:
     - Visualization of candidate locations.
     - Clustering of locations to find the optimal number of vertiports (17).
     - Discussion on the ideal number of vertiports without financial constraints.
